# Linear Regression 

Linear Regression is one of the most important and basic concepts in Machine Learning and Data Science. In the notebooks and code given in
the folder, a simple Linear Regression Model has been built on Headbrain Dataset that can be downloaded from Kaggle. Using traditonal mathematical 
modelling and Scikit-Learn Approach, we try to compute the linearity between two variables in this case.
